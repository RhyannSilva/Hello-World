# Hello-World
Learning Github with Github guide

About me:
My name is Rhyan and I'm currently living in Brazil.
A friend of mine reccomended me learning to code 2 years ago but I didn't know this job and was apprehensive.
But in 2020 Covid 19 was spreading fast and I was looking for a job and decided to learn about it more.
I did my subscription to a course that was being given by IMED and Avanade Brasil and was chosen, in this course I learned abou HTML, CSS, JS and many other things that are important to a programmer like Soft Skills.

And now in 2022 I received the news that I'm approved to the Oracle Program "Oracle Next Education" that will give me the chance of build new projects and improve my technology skills.

Now I'm really motivaded to keep learning!! #letscode
